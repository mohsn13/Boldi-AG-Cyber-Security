# Boldi AG Cyber Security Project 

As part of a job simulation for PwC, I conducted a comprehensive cyber security assessment for Boldi AG, a fictional company. In this project, I evaluated Boldi AG's file management practices, identified security issues, and explored the concepts of due care and due diligence. This cyber security project was conducted as part of a job simulation for PwC, aiming to assess Boldi AG's file management security posture and provide recommendations for improvement.

**First Task**

In the first task, I explained integrated defense to Boldi AG, whilst also assessing Boldi AG's security practices and how they failed in both due care and due diligence. The second part of the task was to describe basic risk limitation option (Deter, Detect, Prevent and Avoid)

**Second Task**

The second task involved a risk assessment, where it was found that the way Boldi AG store their files, it fails the CIA Prism. We found that Boldi AG's files are both on paper and in the companyâ€™s cloud-based information system. The files are inconsistent and hard to use for analysis. By doing this, it fails the CIA Prism due to the files being inconsistent it fails the integrity aspect of the prism. In the prism, there must be consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of the data. Due to the inconsistency of  files. 

Another issue is that there is no control over who in the company can access the files. Because of this, Boldi AG fails the confidentiality aspect of the CIA prism due to there not being any privacy, confidentiality measures to prevent sensitive information from unauthorized access.
